This is our submission for the 2018 Hackathon in the xConnect category.

## Category
 xConnect

## Purpose
Identify personas and fire goals based on a twitter HashTag

## Detailed description

The Module automatically tracks all tweets for a specified #hashtag and identify accounts that interact with it and import them to xDB. 
This module helps marketers to identify the profile of each user along with their engagement with the #hashtag, 
e.g. if someone twitts on #schackthon, visit the website , and fill in a VisitUs Form , then we can match the user to a given persona
and show personalized content.

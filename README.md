## Summary

**Category:** xConnect

Purpose :The Module automatically tracks all tweets for a particular #hashtag and identify accounts that interact with it and import them to xDB. This module helps marketers 
to identify the profile of each user, e.g. if someone twitts on #schackthon, we can match the user to the Geek persona and show a Page with personalization on the website(the software can identify if the user already tweeted on that particular hashtah).
